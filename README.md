# StarCharter

<img align="right" width="500" src="example_output/orion_mini.png">

`StarCharter` is a command-line tool for producing vector-graphics charts of
the night sky in SVG, PDF and PNG formats. It can also overlay the paths of
solar system objects, such as planets and comets, across the sky if the tool
[ephemerisCompute](https://github.com/dcf21/ephemeris-compute-de430) is also
installed.

`StarCharter` was written to produce all the star charts on the website
<https://in-the-sky.org>, which is maintained by the author.

### Supported operating systems

`StarCharter` is written in C and runs in Linux, MacOS, and other Unix-like
operating systems.  The installation scripts require python3.  `StarCharter`
uses `libcairo` to produce its graphical output.

The build process requires a minimum of 4GB RAM. Note that Docker Desktop for
Mac imposes a default memory limit of 2GB, which needs to be increased to build
`StarCharter` successfully.

### License

This code is distributed under the Gnu General Public License. It is (C)
Dominic Ford 2015 - 2022.

### Set up

Before you start, `StarCharter` needs to download various data from the
internet, including star catalogues, deep sky catalogues, and an image of the
Milky Way to use to shade the background of star charts.

This can be done with the shell script `setup.sh`. The total download size will
be around 500 MB.

### Docker container

A `Dockerfile` is provided to build `StarCharter`. A `docker compose` script is
provided to build a selection of example starcharts:

```
docker compose build
docker compose run star-charter
```

This builds some example starcharts, which are written to the directory
`examples/output`. To make other star charts, open a shell within the Docker
container as follows:

```
docker run -it star-charter:v1 /bin/bash
```

## Generating a star chart

Once you have compiled the `StarCharter` code, you need to write a
configuration file to generate each star chart you want, specifying which
portion of the sky should be charted, and what labels you want on the chart.
There are some examples in the `examples` directory, and so a good starting
point is to generate one of these:

```
cd examples
../bin/starchart.bin orion.sch
```

This will generate three star charts in the `output` directory, in PNG, SVG and
PDF formats.

The file `orion.sch` reads as follows:

```
DEFAULTS
ra_central=5.5
dec_central=4.0
angular_width=29.0
mag_min=7
width=15.0
aspect=1.41421356
ra_dec_lines=1
constellation_boundaries=1
constellation_sticks=1
coords=ra_dec
projection=gnomonic
star_names=1
star_flamsteed_labels=0
constellation_names=1
plot_galaxy_map=1
plot_equator=0
plot_ecliptic=0
plot_galactic_plane=1
font_size=1.2

CHART
output_filename=output/orion.png

CHART
output_filename=output/orion.svg

CHART
output_filename=output/orion.pdf

CHART
output_filename=output/orion.eps
```

Settings are arranged in blocks which are headed by the words `DEFAULTS` or
`CHART`. Settings in a `DEFAULTS` block do not themselves produce a star chart,
but change the default settings which are applied to all subsequent charts.
Settings in a `CHART` relate to a specific chart that is to be rendered, and do
not affect any subsequent charts which may be rendered later in the same
configuration file.

The file above configures a large number of parameters to produce a star chart
of the constellation Orion, and makes these the default settings. It then
produces three identical copies of the star chart, in three different graphic
formats.

The configuration settings which are recognised are listed below under
'Configuration settings'.

## Paths of solar system objects

The `draw_ephemeris` option in a configuration file can be used to draw the
path of a solar system object across the sky.  This requires the tool
[ephemerisCompute](https://github.com/dcf21/ephemeris-compute-de430) to be installed.

The syntax is as follows:

```
draw_ephemeris = <body>,<jd_start>,<jd_end>
```

where `body` is the name of the solar system object to plot, and `jd_start` and
`jd_end` are the Julian day numbers of the beginning and end of the time period
for which the object's path should be plotted.

Recognised object names include any of the following:

* `p1`, `pmercury`, `mercury`: Mercury
* `p2`, `pvenus`, `venus`: Venus
* `p3`, `pearth`, `earth`: Earth
* `p301`, `pmoon`, `moon`: The Moon
* `p4`, `pmars`, `mars`: Mars
* `p5`, `pjupiter`, `jupiter`: Jupiter
* `p6`, `psaturn`, `saturn`: Saturn
* `p7`, `puranus`, `uranus`: Uranus
* `p8`, `pneptune`, `neptune`: Neptune
* `p9`, `ppluto`, `pluto`: Pluto
* `A<n>`: Asteroid number `n`, e.g. `A1` for Ceres, or `A4` for Vesta
* `C/1995 O1`. Comets may be referred to by their names in this format
* `1P/Halley`. Comets may be referred to by their names in this format
* `0001P`. Periodic comets may be referred to by their names in the format %4dP
* `CJ95O010`. Comets may be referred to by their Minor Planet Center designations
* `C<n>`: Comer number `n`. `n` is the line number within the file [Soft00Cmt.txt](http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/Ephemerides/Comets/Soft00Cmt.txt), downloaded from the Minor Planet Center.

Note also the setting `ephemeris_autoscale`, which overrides the specified
celestial coordinates for the centre of the star chart, and the specified
angular width, and scales the star chart to automatically show the requested
ephemerides.
