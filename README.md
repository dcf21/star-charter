# StarCharter

`StarCharter` is a versatile command-line tool for producing charts of the
night sky. Charts can be generated relative to the local horizon, depicting the
sky as seen from a particular location at a particular time, or as a star atlas
in equatorial or galactic coordinates.  A large array of configuration options
are available to allow the charts to be fully customised.

`StarCharter` can depict the positions of solar system objects - planets,
asteroids and comets - retrieving their positions from NASA's DE430 ephemeris,
and the paths of these objects across the sky over a specified time period can
also be shown.

Charts can be generated in either PNG (bitmap graphics) format for quick
viewing and use online, or in PDF/SVG/EPS (vector graphics) formats for
subsequent typesetting or editing in a vector graphics package such as Adobe
Illustrator or Inkscape.

`StarCharter` was originally developed to produce star charts for the website
<https://in-the-sky.org>.

### License

This code is distributed under the Gnu General Public License. It is (C)
Dominic Ford 2015 - 2024.

### Supported operating systems

`StarCharter` is written in C and runs in Linux, macOS, and other Unix-like
operating systems.  A Docker container is provided to facilitate running
`StarCharter` in the widest possible range of operating systems. The
installation scripts require Python 3.  `StarCharter` uses `libcairo` to
produce its graphical output.

The build process requires a minimum of 4GB RAM. Note that Docker Desktop for
macOS imposes a default memory limit of 2GB, which needs to be increased to
build `StarCharter` successfully.

### Build process

First make a clone of the code in this GitHub repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/dcf21/star-charter.git
```

If you wish to run `StarCharter` locally (not within a Docker container), then
you must run the shell script `setup.sh` to download the data required by each
tool and to compile the software.  This script downloads various data from the
internet, including the DE430 solar system ephemeris, star catalogues, deep sky
catalogues, and an image of the Milky Way to use to shade the background of
star charts.

The total download size will be around 500 MB, and it will take around 10-15
minutes to process the downloaded files.

Note that once you have built `StarCharter`, you must not change its location
within your file system.  During the build process, the absolute path to the
downloaded data files is stored, and the code will be unable to find these data
files if their path changes. If you move the code, you must fully rebuild the
code:

```
make clean
./setup.sh
```

### Docker container

If you would rather run `StarCharter` within a Docker container, then a
`Dockerfile` is provided to build such a container.  This automatically
installs all the software's dependencies within the containerised environment
to make the build process as simple as possible. Additionally, a `docker
compose` script is provided, which automatically build a selection of example
star charts.

To build the `StarCharter` container (this takes 15 minutes):

```
docker compose build
```

To generate a selection of example charts, which are placed in the directory
`examples/output`:

```
docker compose run star-charter
```

To make other star charts, open a shell within the Docker container as follows:

```
docker run -it star-charter:v6 /bin/bash
```

## Generating your own star charts

The configuration options for each star chart are specified in a configuration
file, where options are specified in the format

```
<option_name>=<option_value>
```

The available options include which portion of the sky should be charted, what
labels should be placed on the chart, etc.  The directory `examples` within
this repository contains numerous example configuration files, and there is a
complete list of all the available configuration options below.

There are some examples in the `examples` directory, and so a good starting
point is to generate one of these:

```
cd examples
../bin/starchart.bin orion.sch
```

This will generate a chart of the constellation Orion in the `output`
directory. Three files are created, in PNG, SVG and PDF formats.

The file `orion.sch` reads as follows:

```
DEFAULTS
ra_central=5.5
dec_central=4.0
angular_width=29.0
mag_min=7
width=15.0
aspect=1.41421356
show_grid_lines=1
constellation_boundaries=1
constellation_sticks=1
coords=ra_dec
projection=stereographic
star_names=1
star_flamsteed_labels=0
constellation_names=1
plot_galaxy_map=1
plot_equator=0
plot_ecliptic=0
plot_galactic_plane=1
font_size=1.2

CHART
output_filename=output/orion.png

CHART
output_filename=output/orion.svg

CHART
output_filename=output/orion.pdf
```

Settings are arranged in blocks which are headed by the words `DEFAULTS` or
`CHART`. Settings in a `DEFAULTS` block do not themselves produce a star chart,
but change the default settings which are applied to all subsequent charts.
Settings in a `CHART` relate to a specific chart that is to be rendered, and do
not affect any subsequent charts which may be rendered later in the same
configuration file.

The file above configures the required parameters to produce a chart of the
constellation Orion, and makes these the default settings. It then produces
three copies of the star chart, in three different graphic formats.

A complete list of all the configuration settings which are recognised are
listed below under 'Configuration settings'.

## Paths of solar system objects

The `draw_ephemeris` option in a configuration file can be used to draw the
path of a solar system object across the sky. The syntax is as follows:

```
draw_ephemeris = <body>,<jd_start>,<jd_end>
```

where `body` is the name of the solar system object to plot, and `jd_start` and
`jd_end` are the Julian day numbers of the beginning and end of the time period
for which the object's path should be plotted.

Recognised object names include any of the following:

* `p1`, `pmercury`, `mercury`: Mercury
* `p2`, `pvenus`, `venus`: Venus
* `p3`, `pearth`, `earth`: Earth
* `p301`, `pmoon`, `moon`: The Moon
* `p4`, `pmars`, `mars`: Mars
* `p5`, `pjupiter`, `jupiter`: Jupiter
* `p6`, `psaturn`, `saturn`: Saturn
* `p7`, `puranus`, `uranus`: Uranus
* `p8`, `pneptune`, `neptune`: Neptune
* `p9`, `ppluto`, `pluto`: Pluto
* `A<n>`: Asteroid number `n`, e.g. `A1` for Ceres, or `A4` for Vesta
* `C/1995 O1`. Comets may be referred to by their names in this format
* `1P/Halley`. Comets may be referred to by their names in this format
* `0001P`. Periodic comets may be referred to by their names in the format %4dP
* `CJ95O010`. Comets may be referred to by their Minor Planet Center designations
* `C<n>`: Comer number `n`. `n` is the line number within the file [Soft00Cmt.txt](http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/Ephemerides/Comets/Soft00Cmt.txt), downloaded from the Minor Planet Center.

Note also the setting `ephemeris_autoscale`, which overrides the specified
celestial coordinates for the centre of the star chart, and the specified
angular width, and scales the star chart to automatically show the requested
ephemerides.

## Change history

**Version 6.0** (26 Aug 2024) - Removed external dependency on [ephemerisCompute](https://github.com/dcf21/ephemeris-compute-de430) to show the positions of solar system objects. This can now be done natively by `StarCharter`.

**Version 5.0** (24 Aug 2024) - Added a huge array of new configuration options. The default projection has been changed to `stereographic`, which can display fields of view as wide as 360 degrees. A new option for the setting `coords` - `alt_az` - allows the local sky to be drawn for a particular location.

**Version 4.0** (16 Oct 2022) - Bugfix release.

**Version 3.0** (14 Dec 2021) - Initial public release.
